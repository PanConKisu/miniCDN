thanks for being interested in my code.
This code uses express, https, fs and other packages to set up a basic but useful CDN with which you can pull content from a specified folder from a url.

The port is a value that you must change as well as the SSL certificate keys if you want to use the HTTPS version.
The content distribution directory is "public" (you can change this value at any time).
